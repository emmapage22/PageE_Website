“Three weeks ago, we were out on tour with artists like Tame Impala, Billie Eilish, and Sturgill Simpson … and then all of the sudden, there are no concerts anywhere – basically in the world,” said Chris Spinato, a representative from REVERB, a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing concerts’ footprints on the environment and encouraging people to make environmental and social change.

Thanks to COVID-19, music venues all around the world have temporarily shut down. Artists, including those partnering with REVERB, have postponed their tours.

REVERB partners with artists, festivals, and venues to ditch single-use plastic at events and connect fans face-to-face with organizations that are “working to create a better future for people and the planet,” according to their website.

Without these live shows and face-to-face interactions, REVERB has had to get creative.

“Like everybody else, we’re just trying to figure out what this means for us in the short term, in the long term, and figuring out how to continue to do our work in some capacity, even if it’s not at live shows,” Spinato said.

The music industry is at a standstill, uncertain how to move forward without answers.

REVERB is staying flexible, checking in with artist partners who are currently looking to state and federal guidance, as well as guidance from the CDC, Spinato said.

“We’re doing whatever we can to make sure that we have staff available and resources available so that when music gets going again, and it will get going again, we’re ready and able to be a partner, supporting them as they all work to try to reduce the environmental impact of live music,” Spinato said.

In the organization’s 16 years, it has prepared for and encountered single tour and festival cancellations due to bad weather or a sick musician, but agrees that this pandemic is unprecedented.

“We’re trying to figure out how to start talking about environmental issues again, because not only do we have this pandemic, but the reality is that climate change is still there. It’s still a problem,” Spinato said.

REVERB is tackling these issues like climate change by staying positive, motivated, and engaged.

“We’re still trying to figure out how to best connect with people,” Spinato said.

One of the ways REVERB is reaching out during this pandemic is by partnering with a group called Goggles for Docs, asking for donations of used ski goggles to deliver to frontline health care workers around the country that currently don’t have protection for their eyes.

A series of artists will perform on REVERB’s Facebook page through Facebook Live to spread awareness of this project.
