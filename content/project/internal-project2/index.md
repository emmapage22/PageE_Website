George Marius closes Zoom after teaching his students during the day. Two hours later, if not religiously playing Animal Crossing, he logs onto another Zoom call, but this time as the extravagant drag queen Desiree Dik.



Before coronavirus, these activities would remain separate. Now, cultivating young minds and drag performing are done under the same roof – Marius’s home in Columbia Heights.



The D.C. area’s drag scene has been well-acquainted with this 27-year-old performer for five years, but with everyone now stuck at home, drag culture has certainly shifted into uncharted creative territory.



“Online drag is really hard to do,” Dik said.



“If you really want to do a nice performance, you have to get good angles, the right lighting, and music … then editing and uploading takes hours. It’s just too much.”



Dik is a regular performer at Red Bear Brewing Company, an all-inclusive bar in NoMa that just celebrated its first anniversary.



“Red Bear is for everybody,” said Bryan Van Den Oever, co-owner.



“We are not a gay bar; we are not a straight bar; we are a bar.”



For the past year, Red Bear has welcomed its customers by giving a platform (and platform heels) to drag performers in the D.C. area.



The venue hosts multiple drag shows per month, as well as drag bingo and trivia nights, which are all American Sign Language inclusive.



“We’re definitely in the [D.C. drag] culture,” Van Den Oever said.



“Desiree has put on amazing shows and cultivated these events that we’re doing.”



However, many of these events now have had to be pushed back or held online.



Before D.C.’s stay-at-home order, Dik said she went to Red Bear and helped organize online drag bingo, but now she must do it from home.



“I’ve been trying to see if I can help Red Bear have some sales with food and alcohol and get some interaction with the crowd,” Dik said.



The first Friday of each month at Red Bear has previously been dedicated to “Slay Them” drag competitions between new drag people.



“When we say people, it’s them – drag kings, drag queens, drag thems…” Van Den Oever said.



The winners of each competition were set to perform in a pageant in May, but the pageant was canceled.



Months of preparation were lost.



“I had to take back all the clothes that I had,” Dik said.



Dik’s own show, “Oddball,” which is a spooky take on drag, is still on, she said.



On April 5, she posted “The Oddball Virus – Digital Drag Show” on Vimeo, charging $5 for access to the video.



“Thank you so much for supporting local drag,” the caption read.



“ ’Cause if you don’t … we die.”



The show wasn’t live because live digital drag comes with many limitations, Dik said.



“Facebook is restraining music and I’ve heard some drag performers are getting cut off on Instagram Live after 30 minutes or so,” Dik said.



“Some people have done a two-part drag show, but a lot of people don’t get that interested sometimes. Even though we are all at home, people are still busy.”



Performing at home is much different than performing for a crowd, she said.



Dik explained that for some drag performers right now, stakes are high.



“Some people are doing really great, like the famous drag performers or people that are really good with the tech stuff,” she said.



“But some drag queens don’t have regular jobs like I do during the day and drag is all they rely on, and some people who can’t do it, like the older people who are drag queens, can’t make their money.”



When this stay-at-home order lifts, Dik hopes that people will be more excited than ever about going to local drag shows, especially since drag performers are working so hard promoting themselves online.



“I hope people are going to be more appreciative, like, ‘Oh my god, I’m touching a drag queen again!’” Dik said.



This difficult time has emphasized how important it is to support local drag performers and the obstacles that they are facing to do what they love and entertain, Dik said.



“I think it also is making us realize how much art is needed and also how creative people are,” she said.



“People can’t be stopped from expressing themselves or making their coin.”
